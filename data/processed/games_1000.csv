38,221100,DayZ,2018-12-13,"This is your Story DayZ is a hardcore survival game where players must strive to endure a post-apocalyptic world populated by frenzied infected and other survivors. DayZ includes the original Chernarus terrain, and the Livonia terrain. Chernarus – The iconic DayZ terrain, set in the post-soviet state of Chernarus and encompassing 230 km2 of hand-crafted environment based on real life locations. Livonia – The dense 163 km2 map lets players experience the hardcore survival hit in a whole new environment. Players can put their survival skills to the test by venturing into the unfamiliar land of Livonia, and seeing just how long they can last in this deadlier-than-ever world. Meet Others Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one. Survive Chernarus The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more. Loot Up Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask. Take your Shot Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back. Install Mods Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like-minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste. Browse thousands of fan-made features, maps, and guns – all of which are easily managed directly from the game launcher. Enter Livonia Teeming with wildlife, ruins, and hidden locations, Livonia offers 163 km2 of fields, forests, and mysterious landscape – a unique new experience that will appeal to newcomers and DayZ veterans alike. Explore the Land An exciting variety of undiscovered locations awaits the brave and adventurous. Explore murky swamps, abandoned hunting cabins, sawmills and deforested areas, as well as massive quarries containing stashes of leftover explosives. Follow the bear Livonia’s food supply is scarce. If you want to survive, you’ll have to learn how to hunt, fish, and forage in the unforgiving wilderness. Luckily, the land appears to be more alive now than it ever was before the apocalypse. Discover the secret Venture south and find the hidden entrance that leads to a mysterious underground complex. Make sure you’re with a friend while you look for a way in. And don’t forget to bring some supplies, especially a flashlight. Otherwise you might get lost in the darkened maze of corridors awaiting all who enter.

Spend your afternoon dogfighting in fighter jets, before winding down in a treehouse that exists floating in a nebula. Make a new best friend while exploring a haunted mansion, right before playing a hand of cards with a robot, alien, and eight-foot tall wolf. In VRChat, there are hundreds of thousands of worlds, millions of avatars – all created by the users . No matter what you’re into, there’s a space in VRChat for you. And if there isn’t, we’ll give you the tools to make your dream a reality. While not required to join in on the fun, VRChat was built to take advantage of VR headsets in many unique ways. That means avatars that flow with your movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more. There’s something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what you find. In VRChat, there’s always something to do – and people to meet there. Visit a planetarium and have a chat about astronomy. Go on a virtual hike through a majestic fantasy forest. Pull up to a car meet, and talk shop with some gearheads. Attend a live music event underneath a chemical storage facility, and talk obscure genres with DJs. Once you find your crowd, join their Group, and you'll be able to find them again the next time you're on. Your community – whatever it is – is here. There are thousands of games to play in VRChat. Try running a kitchen in a busy restaurant, or racing go-karts in zero gravity. Fancy a battle royale? We’ve got those, too -- just probably with a wider diversity of avatars than you’ve ever seen before. It doesn’t matter what you like to play: casual card games, shooters, racing, platformers, puzzles, horror, and of course, endless party games. If you want to play it, it probably exists here (and if it doesn't, you can build it yourself). Everything here was built by the community using the VRChat SDK. Combined with Unity and Udon, our in-house scripting language, we give our users as much power as possible to build whatever their imaginations can conjure up. But creation isn’t just limited to worlds. VRChat provides a level of creative freedom that is unmatched anywhere else, and nowhere is that reflected best than on the avatars of our users. In VRChat, you can be anything, and explore your identity however you’d like. Want to be an alien? A talking dog? A sentient shoe with glowing bits that react to the beat of music by changing color? I mean, sure, if that’s what you’re about. Come on in -- hundreds of thousands of worlds (and a whole bunch of new friends!) are waiting for you.

Be Ruthless Ruthless is an optional game mode which offers a more challenging way to play Path of Exile. Ruthless players can expect extreme item scarcity, limited crafting and many other changes such as support gems being drop-only. Ruthless is a mode about friction, tension and anticipation. It's much more difficult, but overcoming that difficulty feels highly rewarding. In a world where your items are far below par, every item drop has the potential to be the breakthrough one you need.

27,346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,2017-08-27,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it! FEATURES ARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically off of surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail. Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects.

95,294100,RimWorld,2018-10-17,"RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that!

Built for endless adventure, the massive open world of The Witcher sets new standards in terms of size, depth, and complexity. • Traverse a fantastical open world: explore forgotten ruins, caves, and shipwrecks, trade with merchants and dwarven smiths in cities, and hunt across the open plains, mountains, and seas. • Deal with treasonous generals, devious witches, and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services. • Make choices that go beyond good &amp; evil, and face their far-reaching consequences. Take on the most important contract of your life: to track down the child of prophecy, the key to saving or destroying this world. • In times of war, chase down the child of prophecy, a living weapon foretold by ancient elven legends. • Struggle against ferocious rulers, spirits of the wilds, and even a threat from beyond the veil – all hell-bent on controlling this world. • Define your destiny in a world that may not be worth saving.

Confront and learn to counter special abilities ranging from invisibility to fire breathing to lightning attacks. STRUGGLE AGAINST NATURE Zombies aside nature does plenty to make life hard. Forage wild fruits and vegetables. Hunt animals for pelts and meat, or in some hostile environments become the prey. Fish for food and garbage. Plant a crop and make sure it gets rain. Seek warmth and take shelter from blizzards. DEAL WITH OTHER PLAYERS Friend or foe there's a lot of interesting people online. Arrest bandits with handcuffs and blindfold them as a non-lethal strategy. Fight with every kind of weapon under the sun - swords, machine guns, snipers, missiles, landmines - you name it.

The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.

Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience.

219,376210,The Isle,2015-12-01,"The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors. Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature. Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise. Survival or Sandbox? The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge. A Global Community Story The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline. Future Development Goals We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include: Playable aquatic and aerial creatures Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles Two new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenous Evolve into advanced 'strain' versions of certain dinosaurs Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours Additional world biome types such as thick jungles Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system Global in-game world quest Localization of all in-game menus &amp; text Better accessibility &amp; customization options Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes Mod support using Steam Workshop All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received-- --End Promotional Protocol-- --SiGnaL InTeRrUpt-- -tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev -",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/376210/header.jpg?t=1653237914,https://survivetheisle.com,"['Multi-player', 'MMO', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Valve Anti-Cheat enabled']","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Indie', 'Massively Multiplayer', 'Simulation', 'Early Access']",0,73561,16917,10065,81,80

77,700330,SCP: Secret Laboratory,2017-12-29,"Deep within one of the SCP Foundation’s emergency containment sites, a catastrophic containment breach leads to multiple SCP subjects being released from their cells. With containment compromised, facility personnel rush to evacuate while waiting for Mobile Task Forces to arrive and restore order, but with the Class-D population running amok in a desperate attempt to escape, along with the involvement of the Chaos Insurgency, the fate of Site-02 remains uncertain. SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP:SL) is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game where you must escape from fearsome entities, or fight to secure a facility under the control of the SCP Foundation, an organisation which seeks to secure and contain anomalous items and creatures in order to protect humanity. These objects, or SCPs, range from mundane-looking items with extraordinary effects, to horrific abominations capable of bypassing the most impenetrable containment methods the Foundation puts in place. Throughout the game, you will witness the perspective of the 5 different human classes, each trying desperately to survive. These include: Scientists: Foundation personnel caught in the midst of the chaos, they must work with Facility Guards and the Mobile Task Force while using their equipment and wits to escape. Class-D Personnel: Prisoners and test subjects using the breach to their advantage, they start with nothing and will do anything it takes to escape from the Foundation. Facility Guards: The woefully unequipped first responders who must help the Scientists escape, prevent the Class-D from escaping, and hold back the SCPs for as long as possible until the Mobile Task Force arrive. Mobile Task Force: Specialised re-containment agents sent into containment breaches to restore order and eliminate threats, they are tasked with assisting in the evacuation of Scientists and taking down anything that poses a threat to the Foundation. Chaos Insurgency: Soldiers of an unknown directive, who are ordered to attack major Foundation sites and terminate all Foundation personnel. They also aim to rescue Class-D Personnel in order to gather useful information from them. Site-02 is a sprawling maze of different zones. Light Containment Zone, where Scientists and Class-D Personnel reside. Heavy Containment Zone, where the SCPs are contained. Entrance Zone, where Facility Guards are stationed, and Surface Zone, where the evacuation point is located, along with the insertion points for Mobile Task Forces and Chaos Insurgents. The site is prepared for these breaches, containing numerous emergency measures — from Tesla Gates able to electrocute anything caught in the blast, to emergency bulkheads able to temporarily hold back threats from a fleeing target, or even the on-site nuclear warhead capable of vaporising the entire underground section of the site. Despite all the security precautions and safety measures, Site-02 is not impenetrable . Fight alongside and against other players in order to help the Foundation restore containment and order, sabotage the site as the Insurgency, or kill everyone as a SCP in a murderous rampage. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ SCP:SL was initially inspired by the well-known single-player horror game, SCP – Containment Breach (2012) by Undertow Games. Northwood Studios has since deviated from Containment Breach — instead opting to create a more unique and original game environment, complete with its own expanding lore. The Studio's aspiration is to present players with an authentic and immersive game experience that is strongly rooted within the SCP universe.

It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. “This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.

However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night.

And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger.

It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.

As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable - including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually. After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos. Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now. Abiotic Factor brings a 90’s sci-fi twist and rich character progression to the multiplayer open world survival crafting genre. Up to 6 players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry. Between alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps - everything your big science brain can muster! Make yourself at home - you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more. Don your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force. Working at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan.

845,392160,X4: Foundations,2018-11-30,"X4 is a living, breathing space sandbox running entirely on your PC. Thousands of ships and stations trade, mine and produce, all realistically simulated. In this universe, you can grow from being the lone pilot of a fighter ship, to managing a vast empire, commanding your fleets and designing colossal space stations. Transition seamlessly from first-person action, boarding ships and visiting their bridges, to an expansive strategy and management simulation. Choose your own path at your own pace. The decisions are yours. Trade - Fight - Build - Think. Start your journey In X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction . Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide. Fly every ship X4 allows you to fly all ships personally . From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships . You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair. Build space stations and upgrade your ships Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale . In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative . Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship. Experience the most dynamic X universe ever X4 is the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires ; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe . Manage your empire with a powerful map Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions. Dive into the most detailed X economy ever One of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy . Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources . Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy. Research and teleport The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation . Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392160/header_alt_assets_2.jpg?t=1740085754,https://www.x4foundations.com,"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'Steam Cloud', 'Family Sharing']","['Action', 'Simulation', 'Strategy']",0,18115,4726,4263,78,84
243,1366540,Dyson Sphere Program,2021-01-20,"Dyson Sphere Program is a sci-fi sandbox construction game with space, adventure, exploration and factory automation elements. In the future, humanity creates a supercomputer known as the 'CentreBrain' with the hope of utilizing its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the application of virtual worlds. You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that CentreBrain needs. Each game features a unique and one-of-a-kind universe Start with a small workshop and improve it until it spans the whole galaxy Engage in battles, construct defensive structures to repel enemy attacks Explore a vast universe with various celestial bodies, including neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holes Automate production beyond planetary surfaces, transporting resources across star systems Develop your very own Dyson Spheres Perfectly show the constructions you've completed on a planet's surface Blueprint allows you to save important plans Customize the mecha to create unique designs and traverse the universe with your creation To construct a Dyson Sphere, you need to utilize automation. Start simple and gradually increase complexity. Maximize the stable output of resources through automated facilities. Connect resources with conveyor belts, transporting raw materials to processing facilities, and then conveying the products to the next stage. Progress from basic transport lines to elaborate plans for factories with diverse outputs. Utilize your production to drive technological advancements, meeting the necessary conditions for building the Dyson Sphere. During the construction, buildings will automatically snap to the grid. When laying conveyor belts, the use of snapping allows for automatic alignment, significantly improving efficiency. This enables the creation of large-scale automated production lines. The construction of the Dyson Sphere relies on vast and efficient factories. The convenient blueprint technology allows you to save your essential plans. You can save factory designs as blueprints and deploy them directly in other locations, eliminating the hassle of repetitive operations. You can construct Dyson Shells on multiple orbits, and each layer of the Dyson Shell can be customized. Connect various nodes on the Dyson Shell, creating the patterns you desire. Each Dyson Sphere is a unique masterpiece crafted by you. Each planet will have unique mineral distribution and ecological characteristics. Every time you enter the game, you can experience a randomly generated and entirely new starmap, with landscapes and resource deposits changing accordingly. Each planet has its own orbit, experiencing the gravitational effects of its star with rotation and revolution, resulting in day and night changes influenced by the star. In addition, there are unique celestial bodies such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holes, awaiting your exploration in this vast universe. The resources on a single planet might be insufficient for such an extensive project. You can harness the abundant resources of other planets. Overcoming the constraints of surface transport, establish your interstellar transportation routes. Interconnect planets with fleets of transport ships, tapping into the unique resources of each planet to ensure an uninterrupted supply of raw materials for your factories. Not only can you paint Icarus in your favorite colors, but you can also customize every component, creating your vision of a futuristic light industrial mech. The Dark Fog has arrived, resenting countless challenges to your factory construction endeavors. In addition to pursuing the goal of building the Dyson Sphere, you must also focus on defending your factories in Rise of the Dark Fog. The Dark Fog will do everything possible to hinder the progress of the 'Dyson Sphere Program,' with Icarus also being a target of their attacks. Be prepared! Don't rely solely on Icarus to face the overwhelming numbers of the Dark Fog. COSMO has devised contingency plans to assist you in repelling the attacks of the Dark Fog. While constructing factories, you'll need to deploy essential defense structures. The more active your operations, the more frequently the Dark Fog will launch fierce assaults. Utilize your defense facilities to unleash 'fireworks' and disperse the Dark Fog. We are Youthcat Studio from Chongqing, China. Starting as a team of five, we have grown steadily (though not excessively) as we journey alongside Dyson Sphere Program. Driven by our love for science fiction, we've created this game—taking you from building the first mining machine to establishing automated factories across the cosmos.

Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. FEATURES Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No 'hero' characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a 'game', you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world.

Sitting in a remote forested valley, the dilapidated homestead will test all your abilities as you attempt to turn it into the most prosperous ranch in the region – either alone or in up to four player co-op multiplayer. Rebuild Your Ranch The years have not been kind to your family ranch and it will take time and money to restore it to its former glory. Buy tools from the local hardware store and purchase a range of vehicles from the garage to help with your rebuilding projects. Renovate the main house, decide what livestock you want to farm and construct the barns, pens and runs you’ll need to keep them safe and secure. Look After Your Livestock Grand building projects are one thing. Paying for them? That’ll come down to your ranching skills. Overseeing a profitable operation is all about the day-to-day. Once you’ve selected and taken on your livestock, regular feeding and watering will keep them healthy. Successful breeding and careful rearing of the young will help boost the numbers in your herds and flocks — and the more produce you have to sell, the more income you’ll receive for all that hard work. Expand your ranch enterprise by farming crops, producing sausages and cheese and even training and selling horses. Head Out on the Hunt There’s a large open-world environment outside your cosy homestead and it’s teeming with wildlife. So when you feel like slowing the pace, why not grab your trusty rifle and head out into the forest to stalk deer and hunt bears?

333,1363080,Manor Lords,2024-04-26,"Manor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest. Inspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable. Manor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed. Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth. Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly. Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide. Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter. From boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests. Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation. Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers. Yours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering. Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead? Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely – a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well. Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city. This game is a passion project started by a solo developer .

179,305620,The Long Dark,2017-08-01,"Bright lights flare across the night sky. The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls 'the pinnacle of an entire genre'. THE LONG DARK is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION brings you the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates. Widely considered the paramount Survival game of all time, SURVIVAL EDITION gives you pure focus on THE LONG DARK’s Survival Sandbox -- the experience that started it all! In THE LONG DARK , you are getting both the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates, and the award-winning episodic narrative mode, WINTERMUTE. Included with both THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION and THE LONG DARK , Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative Survival Sandbox that has defined the genre since launching on Steam in 2014. After years of open development and dozens of major updates, THE LONG DARK now stands at the pinnacle of the entire genre. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. The game that defined death for the survival genre. When you die in Survival, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. Explore a 50+ square kilometer Northern Canadian wilderness spanning 12 major regions and all the zones that connect them in search of life-saving supplies. Distant mountains, coastal towns, mines, farmlands, and a huge expanse of brutal winter wilderness to test your survival mettle. Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Additional Challenges include: Hopeless Rescue, Nomad, Archivist, As the Dead Sleep, and Escape the Darkwalker. Included in THE LONG DARK The episodic story-mode for THE LONG DARK, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episode Five is in development, and is slated for release at a later date. This will bring the WINTERMUTE storyline to its conclusion. The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free when it is released. Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? NOTE: Unlike Survival Mode, WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. You can save your progress as you play. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. In addition to releasing the remaining episode of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode with limited free updates alongside our paid DLC Expansion Pass, TALES FROM THE FAR TERRITORY. This is on top of the over 100 updates we have made to the game over the past 8 years of open development. Keep in mind that your purchase of THE LONG DARK entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE without extra charge.

For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back — but to little avail. Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you — and the world itself — forever changed. PLAY YOUR HERO, YOUR WAY Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset.

Who will stay, and who will go? Make your choices, and watch the world around you change. A NEW WAY TO FIGHT Enjoy two combat modes as you slay your enemies – real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly, so you can always take things as slowly — or as quickly — as you like.

CHOOSE YOUR PATH Explore nine unique Mythic Paths: obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next.

You can enjoy the new Endless Mode (with 3 ways of playing it) that increases the replayability of the game. There is also a new scenario - The Fall of Winterhome , that further expands the game’s universe and lore. And for the dessert, we’ve added things like naming characters and automatons and finally a photo mode . All of this is available for free for all the owners of the game. There are also three expansions, available with the paid Season Pass . At the same time we would like to inform you that we are not planning to create any more content for Frostpunk, as this journey is over for us, but there are more to come in the future, so be sure to keep an eye out for our games. Of course the game will still receive patches and fixes and we’ll provide the technical support. SEASON PASS The Official Season Pass for Frostpunk is out and complete! It grants you access to all additional content released for the game since the premiere, including three expansions ( The Last Autumn , On The Edge and The Rifts ), that widely broaden the main story and fill a lot of gaps in the game’s universe.

Not having the game at all? Worry no more, as the Frostpunk: Game of the Year Edition is what you are looking for. It includes the main game, season pass and all exclusive content at a discounted price. ABOUT THE GAME THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure.

670,805550,Assetto Corsa Competizione,2019-05-29,"Assetto Corsa Competizione is the new official GT World Challenge videogame. Thanks to the extraordinary quality of simulation, the game will allow you to experience the real atmosphere of the GT3 championship, competing against official drivers, teams, cars and circuits reproduced in-game with the highest level of accuracy ever achieved.

839,784150,Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic,2024-06-20,"Manage all aspects of your republic in this soviet-themed city builder game. A planned economy puts you in control of everything from mining resources to manufacturing goods and providing services – use this power to make decisions that impact your citizens’ day-to-day lives and their ultimate loyalty to the nation. Whether it’s construction, transportation, trade, healthcare, education, entertainment, tourism, or any of the countless other facets of a full-fledged city, it’s up to you to determine availability, accessibility, and quality. Contend with a deep simulation of global supply chains as you seek fertile soils, ore veins, and viable lands upon which to build your nation – let the radio stations sing your praises and the citizens rejoice in their glorious soviet republic. Multiple complex simulations work together to bring your cities to life in Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic – whether it’s the price of goods in the global market, the proper distribution of electricity and water, or the increased supply of heat during the winter months, everything can be manipulated with the right actions. Adjust your game settings based on your appetite for complexity in particular areas – civil engineers, urban planners, economists, and simulation enthusiasts will all be able to experience the mechanics they love. Run your nation with both rubles and dollars as you strike a balance between eastern and western markets, trading with nations from either side of the Iron Curtain to gain access to valuable currency, resources, and technology. Despite following a soviet-styled planned economy, you are a fledgling non-aligned nation – this sets you free to engage in trade with both the Western Bloc and the Soviet Bloc to your benefit. Loyalty to one side is always an option, but flooding one market with your goods might result in diminishing returns, and shunning the other side might see you cut off from useful technological advances. Familiarize yourself with the intricacies of realistic supply-chain management with over 30 commodities to acquire, manufacture, and transport. Raw materials, processed goods, and waste material all have specific places where they can be stored, with specific vehicles needed for their transportation, and specific structures needed for loading and unloading. Liquids are stored in tanks and moved with the help of pipes and pumps, or loaded onto vehicles with tanks. Mined ores are stored in aggregate storage facilities, and moved with conveyor belts and flatbed trucks and train cars. Processed goods, meanwhile, are shipped around in covered trucks and train cars, and stored in warehouses. Organize forklifts for short distance hauling, build intricate conveyor belt networks to minimize your reliance on vehicles, or use trains to haul goods from one city to another – supply-chain management is an integral part of operating a nation, and you’ll use everything from cargo planes to freight trains to cargo helicopters to make sure everything is operating smoothly. Every road, bridge, residential building, and factory is built from the ground up with resource costs reflecting the size of the project. Pay market rates for raw materials to execute quick builds with the help of foreign labor, or establish construction offices and provide employment to your population as they head to construction sites to build everything using locally acquired resources. Buildings can require anything from prefab panels, to steel beams, gravel, concrete, and more – produce and supply them locally, or import them to simplify the process. Will you be a self-reliant republic, or will you exploit the international market for rapid expansion? A nation is nothing without its people – they work the fields, bake the bread, and operate the heavy machinery that keeps the wheels of industry turning. Ensuring the people remain happy and loyal is essential to your success. Follow your citizens from childhood to the end of their lives, providing them with essential goods such as food and clothes (and alcohol) while simultaneously ensuring they have access to opportunities in the form of education and employment. Be wary of those that lack loyalty to the republic – they are prone to a life of crime, and their reduced efficiency can hurt throughput. Oftentimes, they are best left without access to opportunities where they can do more harm than good. Monitor your nation’s overall happiness and loyalty to ensure few are choosing to leave – provide them with better lives, or rely on propaganda to get the most out of your citizens. Your peoples’ needs can be imported from neighboring countries, or they can be manufactured locally through complex production chains. Massive fields will harvest grains that can be turned into bread and booze at food factories and distilleries. Clothes factories will produce clothes as long as they have fabric, which in turn is produced at fabric factories with the help of crops, chemicals, and water. Manufacture or otherwise acquire all manner of goods, from the aforementioned necessities to the luxuries of radios and TVs, and transport them from factories to warehouses to local stores where your citizens can obtain them to fulfill their needs. There are many essential services your citizens will want access to as well – electricity, water, and heat are necessary for survival, each with their own supply chains to maintain. Watch for demand to ebb and flow with the seasons, and prepare for harsh winters lest your population suffers a sudden tragic drop. Education is provided through schools and universities, with higher levels of education opening up additional employment opportunities for your people, unlocking access to new technologies and production capabilities in your nation. Entertainment comes from local parks and theaters as well as radio and TV stations, while physical fitness is provided by local pools and sports fields. Ensuring these services are available and within reach through an efficient transit system is essential for a healthy, prosperous populace. From roads to railways, and from sea to sky, managing the transportation of goods and people is vital to the health of your republic. As your nation spreads and cities develop around resource hubs littered across massive maps, you’ll find yourself constantly expanding your transportation network to meet ever-growing needs. Buses, trams, trains, subways, ships, and planes provide public transportation for people to move greater and greater distances, fulfilling needs at distant shops, or providing their expertise at far-flung factories and mines. Operate interconnected systems to facilitate the movement of people across these massive expanses, even using cable cars and winding dirt roads to provide access to the more remote parts of your republic. Trucks, trains, cargo planes, and cargo ships are essential for moving resources long distances, with different subcategories of each vehicle determining exactly what type of goods it can move. Limited access to certain vehicles might force you to explore transit methods you would otherwise have left behind – or perhaps you’ll build connections at customs offices along your border to enable trade with foreign powers instead? Build custom airports, plan the placement of train signals, and design intricate interchanges to truly customize your transit networks. Road signs will influence speed limits and vehicle access, runway length will determine accessibility for various kinds of airplanes, and train stations can be built for passengers or cargo, with access points for pumps, conveyor belts, and forklifts to integrate smoothly into your existing supply chains. Allow your people to purchase cars for private transit, but consider limiting access to such vehicles based on education levels or party loyalty to prevent the plague of freedom of movement and congestion – with well planned infrastructure and transit networks, you can fully control the flow of workers and resources alike. Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic has dedicated modding tools and a plethora of extensive player-created mods available in the Steam Workshop.

Go at it alone, invite up to 8 Steam friends to join your game or play on dedicated servers. Immerse yourself in a deceptively familiar, yet formidable, world The First Cohort of prospectors has been granted initial mining licenses for over 64 square kilometers of hand-crafted terrain, full of hidden caves and biomes to explore. Every single tree is harvestable, every rock can be voxel mined, every creature can be hunted. Tame and ride mounts, craft advanced tech to extract resources faster and prepare yourself for harsher challenges.

Three Game Modes: Open World, limited-time Missions, or creative Outposts However you want to experience Icarus, you can. Forge your claim in Open World, battling the elements and apex predators for survival and testing the limits of your survival instincts. Accept timed Missions to mine exotics and earn Ren as you complete tasks for the power brokers overseeing the planet. Drop down to the planet with nothing, establish a base from scratch and escape in time. Let your creative mind run wild in the Outpost regions with regenerating resources and safe environments. About the world of Icarus Icarus was once destined to be a second Earth, but when terraforming collapsed - the air turned toxic and humanity’s hopes of colonizing a new world died. Icarus became a joke, a symbol of humanity reaching for the stars and failing. The xeno-engineers salvaged what they could, released modified embryos and halted the terraforming process. Yet when they discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these ‘exotics’ sparked a gold rush and fueled political tensions back on Earth. Prospectors flocked to Icarus to complete contracts to extract exotics and conduct research for various factions. Those that survive return to orbit as seasoned veterans, converting their exotics into advanced technology, and taking on ever more challenging drops. Those that get left behind... are lost forever. --- ICARUS is being made by a team of survival game veterans at RocketWerkz in beautiful Auckland, New Zealand.

Two Game Modes with Early Access Players take turns playing a card face down and declaring its value. The value should match the table’s value. (e.g., 'King' or 'Queen'). When a player lays down a card, they might be lying about its value. If you suspect a lie, you can call their bluff. If someone’s bluff is called and they were lying, they must play a round of Russian Roulette. Surviving one bullet out of 6 rounds of shells means you stay in the game; failing means game over for you. After Russian Roulette is played, the cards are reset, and the game continues. Roll your dice. No one can see your roll, but everyone’s watching your next move. On your turn, make a bid predicting the total number of dice on the table, showing a specific face (e.g., 'There are five 3’s'). The next player must either raise the bid by increasing the number of dice or the face value (e.g., 'There are six 4’s') or challenge the previous bid. Think someone’s lying? Challenge their bid! The loser drinks a bottle of poison. Drink two bottles, and you’re out! The last one alive wins!

Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world. This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles. Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh… Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.

Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down. Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement. This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity. Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology. This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.

Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs. The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild. Foxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen? Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well? With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats. Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game.

369,495420,State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition,2020-03-13,"State of Decay 2 is an open-world survival-fantasy game set just after the zombie apocalypse. Your small community of survivors seeks to rebuild a corner of civilization, and you get to make all the decisions about how that happens. You decide who to recruit to your team, where to settle your community, how to fortify and upgrade your base, and when it’s time to move to greener pastures. You select which survivor to bring along on a scavenging run for the food and ammo you need, and who you’ll use to fight off the zombies attacking your base. You choose how you’ll deal with other people who move into your town. Will you be friendly and welcoming... or will you aggressively defend your territory? Every player’s experience in the sandbox is unique. Each character in your community has their own special set of skills and traits, so no two communities are ever the same. The challenges you face also vary from game to game, based on who you recruit and the decisions you make along the way. With co-op multiplayer support, you can visit your friends' communities and help them through a tough spot, bringing back rewards for your own communities later. Alternate game modes include a full 10-hour narrative campaign and a four-player zombie-slaughtering 'siege defense' mode. Undead Labs is proud to present our best-ever vision of the zombie apocalypse. Keep your eyes peeled and your weapons ready. This is one apocalypse you won't want to miss.

772,494840,UBOAT,2024-08-02,"UBOAT UBOAT is a simulator of a submarine from WWII era, yet different than all you have seen so far. It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time. In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish. Survival The extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others. While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer. Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen. If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts. Kriegsmarine career During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems. Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances. Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds. Receive additional permissions for the reputation points. Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more. Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies. Accurate simulation Game's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit. Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game. Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!

Join forces with your backroom staff to assess the strength and depth of your playing squad before dipping into the transfer market. There’s likely to be a starlet in your Academy knocking on the door of the first team… Craft tactical strategies, formations and styles of play for every occasion to maximise your club’s chances of winning football matches and getting those three points. Immerse yourself in the spectacle of match day and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch. Interaction Communicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express every emotion, while Quick Chats improve those short, informal conversations which are part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are. Matchday Every fixture now feels like a true spectacle with our best-looking match engine ever. You’ll receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up and those data improvements combine with our remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action than ever before. FM21 also boasts a raft of AI improvements across every area of the pitch. The rate of decision-making has increased and there’s more nuance to the decisions that players make, allowing them to be more reactive and make faster decisions. This improved decision-making process has enabled better defensive and goalkeeper intelligence, enhanced central play and more variety in the final third. Additionally, you’ll also get more reaction and data post-match, including our brand new SIxG system, which will let you know well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created. Analysis and Stats Our extensive data improvements go beyond Matchdays, giving you all the tools to level up your pre-match preparations. Managers benefit from a vastly increased amount of data reporting and visualisation this year, including monthly reports from the new Performance Analyst that mirrors the data real managers receive. New graphs and data maps provide clearer insight into their team’s strengths and opposition weaknesses, while there’s a wealth of new stats that will give you full statistical overview of the entire pitch. Recruitment New staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game’s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings now ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for your next moves and the club’s longer-term strategy in the transfer market. Moreover, you’ll now be able to approach agents directly about a player's interest in joining your club. End of Season Re-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before. A new season review presentation picks out your best moments on and off the pitch, while showpiece victories feel much sweeter with improved title presentations and masses of media attention. This is a game that rewards planning and knowledge but there’s no pre-defined ending or script to follow, simply endless opportunities. Every club has a story to tell and it’s up to you to write it.",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1263850/header.jpg?t=1671725363,http://www.footballmanager.com/,"['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Cloud', 'Family Sharing']","['Simulation', 'Sports']",0,22344,1558,1405,93,-1

317,282070,This War of Mine,2014-11-14,"This War of Mine: Final Cut contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you don’t own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges. Main changes: Remastered versions of all the classic locations One new classic scenario and a brand-new character New quests and locations added to the original game Vanilla version of the game ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine - main features: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme The universe of This War of Mine has been expanded by following DLCs: The Little Ones - explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective - that of a child. This War of Mine: Stories DLCs: Episode 1: The Father's Promise – a heartbreaking tale of loss and hope in a war-torn city Episode 2: The Last Broadcast – where, as a radio operator, you are going to face moral dilemmas and decide, whether there is a price too high for the truth Episode 3: Fading Embers – portrays a story of Anja living in a warzone and carrying a heavy burden as she has to answer to herself what is more important - survival of human legacy or the survival of a man ",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/header.jpg?t=1741346423,http://www.thiswarofmine.com,"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Family Sharing']","['Adventure', 'Indie', 'Simulation']",83,93611,7180,1362,94,-1

771,365360,Battle Brothers,2017-03-24,"Battle Brothers is a turn based tactical RPG which has you leading a mercenary company in a gritty, low-power, medieval fantasy world. You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory? The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat. Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world. Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries. Permadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead – unless they return as the undead. All characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witch hunter or a drunkard disowned noble? Character development without a restrictive class-system. Each character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks. Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer. Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior. A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat. Three late game crises – a war between noble houses, a greenskin invasion and an undead scourge – add a looming threat. Two full hours of orchestral soundtrack. 70 Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. Overhype Studios is an independent game developer studio from Hamburg, Germany.

457,568220,Lobotomy Corporation | Monster Management Simulation,2018-04-09,"Monsters beyond your imagination, and you: The Manager. Monsters beyond your imagination, and you: The Manager. Monsters beyond your imagination, and you: The Manager. A roguelite monster-management simulation inspired by the likes of the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Order your employees to perform work with the creatures and watch as it unfolds; harness greater energy, and expand the facility. One disaster will lead to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. “I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.” Lobotomy Corporation is a roguelite monster-management simulation. Our game was inspired by the monsters birthed of various inspirations featured in games, film, and series, such as the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Going further, it was developed with this thought: “What if those monsters were real, and your job were to manage them?” You will be playing as the Manager of Lobotomy Corporation, a company in which such creatures are contained and managed. Order your employees to perform work with and on the creatures and watch the results expectantly. Gather energy produced by the monsters and fulfill the quota each day, expand the facility, and manage even more strange beings. In this game, the player will face an ever-present sense of tension and dread as they progress through each day. “Our new technology will bring salvation to humanity.” Lobotomy Corporation is a newly established energy company that isolates Abnormalities and extracts an infinite amount of energy from them by using independently developed technology , or so it seems on the outside. Join the corporation, and witness the true reality with your own eyes. Lobotomy Corp. consists of several departments, much like any other company. You will have access to various departments as you harness more energy. The more departments you have unlocked, the more efficient the management of Abnormalities will become. Furthermore, AIs such as Angela and the ‘Sephirot’ will be at your side to provide all the assistance you need for smooth progression. Beings that you must constantly research and observe. We dubbed the creatures that reside in Lobotomy Corporation, ‘Abnormalities’. You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while extracting as much energy as possible from the Abnormalities. However, you must learn what types of work you should and shouldn’t perform via trial and error. You start with zero information on the Abnormalities. At first, your eyes, ears, and the in-game manual will be your only hints. Let your intuition pick the work type that might suit the Abnormality best. After that, order the employee who is best suited for the job to work on the Abnormality, and wait for the results. In the process of managing Abnormalities, you will gain the power of information. The amount of energy you can acquire from Abnormalities will depend heavily on the type of work your employees perform. This is NOT a tycoon. As mentioned before, Abnormalities are beings that need to be treated with great care. Some might dislike the idea of being locked inside a Containment Unit, and may sometimes attempt to breach containment. A breaching Abnormality will attack every employee in sight and disrupt the facility’s systems. Worse still, it could open up other units and cause more Abnormalities to escape. Furthermore, employees eroded or corrupted by certain Abnormalities will have a greatly adverse influence on other employees. Employees brainwashed by Abnormalities might randomly attack those around them, wholly oblivious to what they are doing. In addition, employees may go insane from serious psychic trauma, disobeying your orders and damaging the psyche of other employees around them. One disaster leads to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. If you fail to resolve a situation immediately, it will ultimately spiral out of control and throw the whole facility into chaos. When such a situation does occur, you will have to gather employees to suppress any threat and regain control of the situation, or give up parts of the facility to ensure the company’s safety. “Tell me, manager. Do you have any wishes?” The game consists of two main portions: Monster Management and visual Story Segments. Once a day of managing Abnormalities and producing energy ends, the story segment will follow right afterward. In the Story Segments, dialogue with Angela (the AI you’ll also be seeing occasionally in the management portion of the game) and the Sephirot will play. As you progress through the missions they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden deep in the company. You may have to ask questions, or answer questions from others. Here, you will uncover the secrets surrounding the company and yourself, and mayhaps even more. “Hello, X.” “I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.”",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/568220/header.jpg?t=1636694188,http://www.lobotomycorp.kr/en/,"['Single-player', 'Family Sharing']","['Indie', 'Simulation']",0,39415,2653,1175,93,94

You’ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you’ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future. Conquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court. Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor—and to test your strength. Explore - Conquer - Rule! The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is an evolution of the 3.5 rules set of the world's oldest fantasy roleplaying game, designed by Paizo, Inc using the feedback of tens of thousands of gamers just like you.

The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called The Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. Complete all the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown. GTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience. Bots can fill your lineup if you’re short one or two players. They’ll follow you through expeditions, sneak when you sneak, collect resources, and fight alongside you. They’re a good fallback, but the level of communication and tactical combat in GTFO means it’s best to play with people. A strategy is necessary to clear the Rundown. Before you drop into The Complex, your team needs to decide what gear, boosters, and weapons to bring. You must also balance the team, identifying the function of each prisoner so that you know what to do when things go wrong. And they will. They always do. Stealth and coordination are necessary to survive as you maneuver through The Complex. Many of the creatures of GTFO are suspended in a state of hibernation, so light, noise, and vibrations can easily wake up these Sleepers. And if one of them knows you’re there, they all know. That’s when things get messy. You’ll need heavy weaponry and a clear mind when the shit hits the fan. Check your line of fire, force them through bottlenecks, set up your kill zones and reload every chance you get. These creatures stop at nothing, and neither should you. Once the mayhem starts, you have no choice but to put every last one of them down. Clearing expeditions and Rundowns will reward you with new cosmetic gear. Wear it with pride, as it proves to your peers you’ve been to hell and back. The Sleepers, on the other hand, will not care for a second.

When combat begins, how the dice from your chosen card fall will determine victory or defeat in the struggle. However, the outcome of the dice is not simply determined by pure luck. Certain effects and variables will shift the outcome of the dice for and against your favor. Be sure to carefully choose which cards you utilize to win the battle with your guests. Behold the outcome of your choices and how luck unfolds as your librarians and guests skirmish. You can go through an exhilarating experience, putting it all on the line with thrills just like betting. [Conflicts that Build Emotion] Confrontation in the Library is not just about killing your enemies, it is about heightening emotions. The emotions of the librarians and guests rise as the battle progresses, and as it grows fiercer and comes to a head, they will surge. Depending on your librarian's feelings, positive outcomes or powerful effects with penalties can occur. In addition, as the emotional tension of the guests grows, the difficulty of combat increases, yet at the same time, rarer books can be acquired. Furthermore, dialogue can appear depending on the situation of the battle and will make one’s viewing experience of the match unfolding even more enjoyable. [Books Can Be Anything] A guest who dies in the Library will turn into a book. These books can be a librarian's body, materials to grow the Library, or new cards for battle. You can also use books as the parts of an invitation to bring forth another guest. Invite different guests to acquire various books, then utilize them accordingly. How you make use of your collection to grow the Library is up to you. [The Story of the City and the Library] In Library of Ruina, you will be witness to the stories of Angela, the Sephirot, and Roland following the ending of Lobotomy Corporation. You will also watch various events occurring around the huge city in which the Library is located. Accumulate books to grow your Library and librarians, and invite more powerful guests to gain better books. From lowly canards to urban legends and beyond... Throughout the game, you will gradually become familiar with the story of the City. May you find your book in this place… ",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1256670/header.jpg?t=1670980516,https://twitter.com/ProjMoonStudio,"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Workshop', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Remote Play on Tablet', 'Family Sharing']","['Indie', 'RPG', 'Strategy']",0,30868,1961,928,94,96

776,1149620,Gas Station Simulator,2021-09-15,"Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun. Key Features Renovate, run and expand a gas station in the desert. Build new services like a workshop, shop, warehouse or car wash. Try to handle everything on your own or hire employees to help out. Interesting events on top of the normal gameplay. Lots of customisation and decoration options. Lots of different customers with varying needs and expectations. Lots of management options for you to dive into.

No matter the obstacle, Leo is willing to get his hands dirty and do whatever it takes to get the job done. VINCENT - Even though he’s fresh off the prison bus, Vincent is determined to break out. With quick wits and nothing left to lose, he'll prove that he's not to be underestimated by anyone, inside prison or out. TOGETHER THEY'LL FIND A WAY OUT - Escaping prison with a complete stranger isn't ideal circumstances, but Leo and Vincent have too much riding on it to second-guess themselves now. As freedom gets closer and closer, they'll have to learn to trust each other if they want to make it to the other side.

425,1451940,NEEDY STREAMER OVERLOAD,2022-01-21,"NEEDY STREAMER OVERLOAD is a “multi-ending ADV” depicting daily life with “OMGkawaiiAngel”, a young girl with a rather extreme need for approval attempting to become the #1 “Internet Angel” (streamer). Gradually build up OMGkawaiiAngel’s number of followers as she spends her days streaming, using various ”stress relievers”, and generally being kinda messed up. Experience all the different crazy ups and downs and find out for yourself whether this story is even capable of having a happy ending. Turn “Ame” – somewhat of a hot mess of a girl – into an OMGWTF-cute internet angel and jumpstart her career as a live streamer for the most hardcore nerds online! Ame: While she may look somewhat low-key and quiet, she’s actually a ridiculously selfish and vapid girl with a tendency to get carried away and a desperate need for approval. She’s, well... kind of troublesome personality. Likes: Her S.O./producer, “P-chan”; psychotropics. OMGkawaiiAngel: An “internet angel”. Ame’s alter ego, used while streaming. Pretends to be really nice and sweet. Constantly flirts with nerd types. P-chan: Gender, age, and all details are unknown. Or maybe it's you? ■As Ame’s beloved (???) “P-chan”, offer daily commentary and guidance to help foster her into a top-tier streamer. Under your direction and guidance, she can amass more and more devoted listeners/obsessed fans, turning her into a super-popular streamer.– and thus allowing you to squeeze stupid amounts of Super Chat out of her donation-happy otaku followers. ■Gotta get topics for streaming! Let's do all kinds of things from afternoon to evening to find out hot topics for streaming. Sometimes you just need to take a little break because streaming can be stressful. Take Ame on dates, serve her up a little bit of naughtiness once in awhile, provide her with a little something-something to take the edge off when she needs to release some pent-up stress, and use social media to grumble about to help keep her happy and mentally healthy. But be careful. Depending on your actions, she might increase her 'sickness level' and be swallowed by the darkness of the Internet! *NOTE: This is a perfectly wholesome game, containing absolutely no explicit sexual references or expressions nor illegal substances. For real! You can see the results of your daily actions and behavior via social media, where Ame-chan will use both public and private accounts to talk about you. People have a tendency to act supportive and friendly on the outside, while talking loads of smack and spreading rumors privately. ■You'll get a variety of messages every day! Let's reply back to them with stickers. Ignoring messages is not a human thing to do. Don't make her angry. You’ll sometimes receive long-winded, tedious criticisms and insults, but that’s just par for the course when dealing with a cute girl streaming on the internet. Be sure to take proper care of her. ■The game features multiple endings! Your streamer will do things like become weird and emo for various reasons, subject her trusty P-chan to harm, and generally get messed up in the head. Begin your adventure and see for yourself whether a happy ending is really even possible for a cute yet disturbed girl on the modern-day internet. Let's Plays Welcome! We'd love to hear from you anytime at our official account!

But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it’s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems. In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city’s technology and holds key information on all of the city’s residents. You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city’s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more. Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge. KEY FEATURES HACK THE CITY Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city’s infrastructure. Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city’s CTOS can become your weapon. STREET JUSTICE Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any given situation. The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of attack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons.

Praised by PC Gamer as “brilliant”, IGN as “amazing” and “a superb sequel”, declared a “masterpiece” by Eurogamer, and hailed “a must-play revenge tale among the best in its class” by Game Informer, Dishonored 2 is the follow up to Arkane Studio's first-person action blockbuster and winner of more than 100 'Game of the Year' awards, Dishonored. Play your way in a world where mysticism and industry collide. Will you choose to play as Empress Emily Kaldwin or the royal protector, Corvo Attano?

251,218230,PlanetSide 2,2012-11-20,"PlanetSide 2 is a free-to-play, massively multiplayer online first person shooter (MMOFPS). Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference. THREE WARRING EMPIRES Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory. ENORMOUS MAPS PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings. PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources.

448,418460,Rising Storm 2: Vietnam,2017-05-30,"Rising Storm 2: Vietnam is the next in the series that has twice been PC Gamer’s ‘Multiplayer Game of the Year’ , bringing the franchise into the era of automatic rifles, man-portable grenade launchers and more modern weapons systems. Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for. Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with: 64-player battles 6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities: United States Army and Marine Corps North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) Australian Army Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers 4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and Bushranger Asymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppers More than 20 maps 3 distinct game-modes Proximity VOIP And hundreds of character customization options. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong). SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVN The Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms: US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikes Australian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artillery ARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 Skyraiders For mobility, they have access to full helicopter support: UH-1 “Huey”: provides rapid transport for a squad across the map OH-6 “Loach”: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its miniguns AH-1G “Cobra”: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officer Australian “Bushranger”: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rockets Tactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments! As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time: M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 “grease gun”, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMG M14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper rifles M60 LMG and M16 automatic rifle For heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrower Explosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 Claymore NORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VC The Northern forces offer a broader mix , with the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has: PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trail NLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrage To compete with the Southern forces’ mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth: NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the lines Given their “home field advantage”, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover can’t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraft SA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right “Ho Chi Minh Trail” ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his team’s spawning rate, when times get desperate “Ambush Spawn” ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes. The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons: AK-47 and Type 56 Assault rifles Russian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle MN 91/30 and SVD sniper rifles PPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGs IZh-58 double-barrelled shotgun DP-28 and RPD LMGs RPG-7 rocket launcher MD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps ",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/418460/header.jpg?t=1731945332,https://rs2vietnam.com,"['Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'In-App Purchases', 'Stats', 'Includes level editor', 'Family Sharing']","['Action', 'Massively Multiplayer', 'Simulation', 'Strategy']",81,49174,7500,618,87,90

Surrounded by five others, a third of your group have been infected with the Game Master’s deadly virus and tasked with taking down the other innocent players. Innocents must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected try to pick you off one by one. When playing as an innocent, you’ll progress through the map and come across items to help you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more information on your teammates and what side they’re likely to be on. A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work together to gather weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting blood and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. At the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players to transform into their terror form and attack. You’ll need this form to kill innocent players. In terror form you’re faster, stronger, and have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense killing animations you’ll be able to create some frightening but also amusing gameplay!

They have only the clothes on their backs and a cart filled with supplies from their homeland. The townspeople of Banished are your primary resource. They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enough—there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own. Banished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeople’s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad. There are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.

A tribute to the highly acclaimed film series in which the above quote originated from, No More Room in Hell (PC Gamer's Mod of the Year 2011, ModDB's Editor Choice Multiplayer Mod of the Year 2011), is a co-operative realistic first person survival horror modification for the Source Engine. Taking inspiration from George Romero's 'Of the Dead' series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill. The chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation. Features: Teamwork: Co-operative play with up to eight players. Voice and Text Communications Limited by Distance: The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close! Dynamic Objective Maps: The next playthrough may not be the same as the last! Survival Mode: Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area. A Realistic Approach: In short, no crosshairs with limited 'only when you want it' HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head! Multitude of Different Opponents: Ranging from the iconic 'walking zombie' to the more contemporary 'runners', NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead... Infection: One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure... 30+ weapons and counting, ranging from the diminutive .22 Target Pistol, to the almighty Chainsaw. No ads (on official and community official servers, user-hosted servers may vary) No pay to win items or microtransactions 100% Free (unless you buy the soundtrack DLC &lt;3) No More Room in Hell is a Half-Life 2 Zombification.

With Dorfromantik, you can immerse yourself in a quiet, peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life. At the same time, Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one: To beat the highscore, you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles. In Dorfromantik you start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles. One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits. On some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape. The game ends when the tile stack is used up. As you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks. Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles, new biomes and new quests.

Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain. To quote Jazzuo himself: 'The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well'. Climb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot. Listen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand. Between 2 and ∞ hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 5 hours, but the mean was closer to ∞. Lose all your progress, over and over. Feel new types of frustration you didn't know you were capable of.

Even worse, the Pestilence, an unholy plague not seen for a thousand years, has returned. It sweeps across the land, corrupting everything and everyone it touches.

862,16900,GROUND BRANCH,2018-08-14,"In GROUND BRANCH , you will play as the elite paramilitary arm of the CIA's Special Activities Center/Special Operations Group (SAC/SOG) and lead other special operations forces through challenging deniable ops all over the globe. With deliberate, calculated and unforgiving gameplay, GROUND BRANCH aims to be the true rebirth of the tactical realism genre of the late '90s and early 2000s. Powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 4, GB puts the 'tactical' back in 'tactical shooter'—no compromises. ▶ TRUE FIRST PERSON GROUND BRANCH's unique True First-Person System improves world immersion and awareness of your surroundings, providing zero disconnect between your view and your character's physical presence in the environment. See your foot sticking out of cover? Better tuck it in—enemies may be able to see it (and shoot it) too, but only if their line of sight and muzzle are verifiably unobstructed. Cameras are placed at the character's eyes and bullets originate from the weapon's muzzle. In GROUND BRANCH, what you see is what you get. A minimal HUD with multiple optional elements ensures that vital information is available, but never a constant obstacle to either immersion or your field of view. ▶ UNPRECEDENTED CUSTOMIZATION Say goodbye to pre-defined kits and fully customize your character and gear from basic appearance and outfit to in-depth vest and weapon platform customization, down to individual pouch and attachment placement. What you bring to your mission is determined only by your loadout choice, with realistic consequences: With the upcoming encumbrance and stamina system, too much equipment will impact your character's speed and performance; place a scope too forward on the rail and your sight picture will be too small; bring a long rifle into CQB and weapon collision may prove a hindrance. Forget unlocks, microtransactions and loot boxes. Ground Branch operators get all the right tools for the job straight away—courtesy of the Agency. ▶ OPERATE, COOPERATE Whether in 8-player co-op or 8v8 adversarial game modes, GROUND BRANCH's unforgiving gameplay makes careful and calculated teamwork essential. Gather your teammates and practice in full-featured training areas, including shooting ranges with dynamic targets and customizable killhouses. Integrated VOIP with both 3D positional voice and radio ensures full communication capabilities with no need for third-party software. Text chat and pre-recorded voice messages ( commo rose -style) also available for the mic-less and the shy. Prefer single-player? Missions with friendly A.I. and a full command system are fully planned. ▶ BE IN FULL CONTROL In the tactical shooter realm, movement and weapon handling are king. Take full control of your character with standing, crouching and ( soon! ) prone stances—each with multiple movement speeds—as well as unique weapon postures (including low- and high-ready), leaning and stepping out, free-look (head movement independent from aim), customizable and optional free-aim (dead zone), dedicated mouse sensitivity sliders for point-shooting/unmagnified/magnified aiming, and all-around highly configurable key bindings. You can also choose between speed reloads (drop magazine) and tactical reloads (retain current magazine) on the fly. ▶ ADDITIONAL FEATURES ☑️ = FULLY or PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ⏳ = PLANNED/UPCOMING Missions ⏳ GROUND BRANCH's unique 'campaign' format will deliver smaller, more localized sets of missions based around global hotspots, with a centralized intelligence interface to monitor them and receive new mission orders over time. The choices you make along the way may affect future engagements. ☑️ Based on unique environments all over the world, the non-linear mission and map designs offer multiple entry points and open-ended outcomes. ☑️ Enemies are spawned at mission start, with a degree of randomization to quantity and location. No 'monster closets' or magic enemy spawns based on player location or mission progress. Multiplayer ☑️ Ready Room: A physical multiplayer lobby where you can plan your approach, see your teammates' loadouts, test weapon configurations on a firing range and jointly select insertion points. ☑️ Full and 100% free dedicated server support. Host a server wherever you want! ☑️ Unit patches that can be attached to your character's sleeves and gear. ⏳ Full support for MP ladders. ☑️ After-action review (AAR) following each mission/round. ☑️ Server-side options. Miscellaneous ⏳ Full mod support. ☑️ No item unlocking, hit markers, kill confirmations or score pop-ups. ⏳ Weapon bracing/supporting. ☑️ Varied arsenal: Multiple handguns, submachine guns, carbines, assault and battle rifles, machine guns, DMRs, sniper rifles and explosives to choose from, with selectable ammunition type (e.g. full metal jacket, hollow point or subsonic rounds, smoke grenade color etc.). ☑️ Map variation: In addition to day and night versions as well as weather variation, maps have small details that can change between rounds, such as doors and windows that may be open, closed or blocked. ☑️ Unlimited loadout save slots. ☑️ Item sharing/dropping/pickups. ☑️ Accurate ballistics with penetration, bullet drop and stopping power simulation. ⏳ No regenerating health or health packs: Administer first aid to non-lethal injuries for reduced combat effectiveness. ⏳ Location damage model: Expect visible injuries and consequences, such as limping, reduced arm function, and/or hits to stamina and accuracy. Players immobilized from a non-lethal injury can stay in the fight. ⏳ Carry teammates to safety to administer first aid—or to safely recover their ammo, gear, cargo or body if they are no longer alive. ☑️ Appropriate and realistic playable female characters. ☑️ Partial controller support (configurable).

In battle, Zetterburn uses no weapons except for his razor-sharp claws and ability to control flame. BURN DAMAGE - Zetterburn's special attacks can set opponents on fire, causing them additional damage over time. WILD FIRE - Zetterburn's Down Special places flames on the stage. These flames stay for a period of time, burning any opponents who come in contact with them. FIRE AMP - When an opponent is burning, Zetterburn's Strong Attacks can absorb the flames and launch the burned enemy twice as far, making for an effective killing blow. Orcane is a playful trickster, notorious for escaping even the most precarious of situations. He can transform into water and confuse enemies with a spray of bubbles. PUDDLE TELEPORTATION - Orcane creates a puddle with his Neutral Special or Down Special. He can then teleport to his puddle using his Up Special as a powerful vertical blow or an effective recovery when launched off the stage. BUBBLE EVAPORATION - Orcane can turn his puddle into a pillar of bubbles with his Down Special to trap enemies above the puddle. WATER AMP - When standing on top of his puddle, Orcane can consume the water underneath him to perform powerful Strong Attacks with far greater range and knockback.

Currently an Aerial Ace for the Air Armada, Wrastor is wrecking havoc among the Armada's enemies and generals alike. WINGED FLIGHT - Wrastor can jump 4 times, making him incredible at controlling the air and recovering from the toughest falls even when things look grim. WIND CURRENT - Wrastor can create a Wind Current with his Forward Special, allowing him to move faster within it and chase his targets more effectively. AERIAL ACE - Wrastor performs his charged Strong Attacks in the air instead of on the ground, a first for this genre. Kragg is a defender of the colossal Aetherian Forest. Deliberate and loyal, he is one of the infamous Wall Runners who patrol the Rock Wall. Unlike other Wall Runners, Kragg has the legendary ability to control the earth with his will. ROCK HURL - Kragg can pull a rock out of the ground and hurl it at opponents. After it leaves his hands, the rock becomes a solid piece of stage that either Kragg or other players can break. DEFENSE BALL - Kragg can curl into a ball and roll toward enemies. Although he can be damaged while in ball form, he cannot be knocked away. EARTH PILLAR - Kragg can summon a pillar of earth to his feet regardless of where he is. If Kragg is about to fall to his death, this move can quickly turn his situation around. Forsburn is the disgraced, eldest son of the Firelands' ruling family. After being condemned by the Fire Council and his own brother, Forsburn found refuge in a group of outsiders who had rejected the flame and mastered the way of smoke. SMOKE SCREEN - Forsburn can use his Neutral Special to obscure the battlefield allowing Forsburn to remain hidden inside a cloud of smoke. DECOY - Through his Forward Special, Forsburn can create a smoke facsimile of himself that can attack opponents. The illusory Forsburn breaks into smoke after being hit by a single attack. CONSUME/COMBUST - By using his Down Special, Forsburn can consume his smoke clouds back into his body. After consuming three clouds, Forsburn is charged up and can use Down Special again to combust: knocking opponents away at high speed. Maypul is the self-appointed Guardian of the Aetherian Forest. She commands fearful respect throughout the forest for her unhesitating vigilantism. She uses her agility to trap any unknown intruders before they even realize she is there. WATCHER'S MARK - Maypul can use her Seeds or her Watcher's Dash to mark opponents, making them susceptible to her following attacks. WRAPPED UP - After marking her targets, Maypul can use her Strong Attacks or her trusty Plant to wrap marked opponents in place allowing her to follow up with another attack. SLING SHOT - Maypul can use her vines to sling toward marked opponents, allowing her to elude attacks and quickly close distances. Absa is a famed engineer and martialist of the Elders of the Air Alliance. Despite the laws of the Elders, Absa secretly developed storm techniques in the caves of the Archai mountains. CLOUD CONTROL - Absa can place a cloud using her Neutral or Forward Special. This cloud hangs in the air until Absa bursts it by tapping her Neutral Special and knocking enemies away. THUNDER BOLT - Absa can charge her Neutral Special to create a powerful lightning blast that connects her to her cloud. All opponents caught between the two will be knocked away at high speeds. CONDENSED STORM - Absa focuses the power of a lightning bolt to the tip of her hoof. If she can line up one of her aerial kicks perfectly, she unleashes great power. Etalus is a legendary warrior in his native land. He is one of the last surviving members of the Harbor Guard and uses the power of ice to augment his massive strength. HOME ICE ADVANTAGE: Etalus can use his Forward Special or Forward Tilt to freeze the ground beneath him in order to slide across on the icy surface. ARMORED UP: When standing on ice, Etalus can use his Neutral Special to absorb the ice and create ice armor around his body. AVALANCHE: Etalus can use his Down Special to shatter all nearby ice, instantly freezing any enemies who are standing on it. Ranno was known as be a feared martial artist who trained under wise monks. But now he prefers to peacefully protect his swampy homeland. When he has no other option, you can see glimpses of his rapid and deliberate strikes. POISON STACKS - Ranno’s Specials Strong Attacks and Jab Combo apply up to four poisonous stacks on his opponents. These stacks damage opponents when they attack and can be removed by hitting Ranno. TOXIC TRAP - Ranno’s Neutral Special and Down Special can place his opponents in a Toxic Bubble Trap that makes it easier for Ranno to combo. The length of time in the trap depends on the number of Poison Stacks on the opponent. POISON SPIN - Ranno’s recovery onto stage has three options. He begins it with a Poison Lunge that is quick and knocks opponents away. After the lunge he can quickly Poison Kick down onto the stage with another quick strike. Or he can use the Posion Spin to fire out an array of Posion Darts in many directions. Clairen is a seasoned warrior from a distant future where the heroes of flame vanish and never return. After being defeated by a tyrannical and ever-living emperor, she travels back in time in order to defeat him. IONIZED TIP - Unlike the other soldiers from the future, Clairen manipulates her blade to be two-toned. The end of Clairen's sword is super-charged, allowing her to stun enemies who are hit precisely with the tip. PLASMA ECHO - Clairen dashes forward with her Side Special to quickly escape. The deadly plasma resonance left behind can damage enemies and even KO opponents with its sweet spot. ENERGY FIELD - Performing a Down Special right before an attack hits Clairen will trigger her energy field. This field damages and pushes other Rivals away while nullifying all projectiles that try to enter it. Sylvanos is the heart of the Aetherian Forest. A rageful deity, Sylvanos has only a single goal - to expand the forest over all of Aether. Unfortunately, the great Rock Wall traps the spirit as he patrols the forest’s floor. Sylvanos leads the plant life in the forest looking for ways to expand his dominance. UNTAMED GROWTH - Sylvanos spreads grass as he runs around. The grass leaves if Sylvanos is away from it for too long. Sylvanos can use Down Special to call Plants Rise and damage any opponents standing on grass. SEED SHOT - Sylvanos’ Neutral Special fires a deadly seed into the air. If it hits an opponent it will lock them in place, but if it reaches the ground then it will plant a flower that maintains a permanent fixture of grass on that ground or platform until it is destroyed. BURROW - Sylvanos can dig into solid ground and reappear by digging out from a different position. If he digs under grass he can pop out with a strong bite attack to KO enemies off the top of the screen. Elliana is a snake from the burrows in the Eastern Wastelands who has always dreamt of flying. After her dreams of joining the Air Armada were crushed by an intolerant captain, she sought the aid of Ayala, a brilliant engineer. Together they built a steam-powered flying machine and with it, Elliana now plans to destroy the armada that rejected her. OVERHEAT - Elliana’s ship heats up when she uses specials or her unique double jump that allows her to hover. Once overheated she can no longer use her specials or hover, becoming more vulnerable to her enemies. LETTING OFF STEAM - Elliana can perform Strong Attacks to expel steam away from her ship, lowering her Overheat bar. The steam can also catch opponents or be blown away by attacks. When she is overheated, her strong attacks let off a powerful explosion instead that can KO opponents. ABANDON SHIP - Elliana can use her Up Special to abandon ship even when overheated. She launches herself high into the air and her ship explodes. Be careful, as she is very vulnerable while outside of her ship and she must rebuild it upon landing on the ground. Ori and Sein are from the hit indie game Ori and the Blind Forest and they bring their skills to the test in Rivals of Aether. While Ori works to Bash, Stomp and Glide his way to victory, Sein can use the Spirit Flame or the Charged Flame to put enemies between a rock and a hard place. SPIRIT FLAME – Sein follows Ori around the battlefield. Ori can tap Neutral Special to have Sein quickly fire a Spirit Flame from wherever Sein is. Ori can hold Neutral Special to have Sein use the Charged Flame. BASH – Ori can use Down Special to Bash nearly anything in Rivals of Aether – from characters to projectiles to rocks and plants. Ori can also move around the stage by bashing the Light Grenade that is thrown by using Forward Special. TAG TEAM – When Ori and Sein are close enough, Ori can use Strong Attacks to initiate tag team combos. These Strong Attacks have more powerful properties as Sein assists Ori for a more devastating blow. Shovel Knight has learned a lot during Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove and he brings those skills with him to Rivals of Aether. Shovel Knight swings, digs and shovel drops his way through the Rivals roster. He does it all while collecting treasure which he can use to purchase upgrades to give him the upper hand on the battlefield. TREASURE HUNTER – Shovel Knight’s attacks knock coins and gems out of his opponents. He can collect these to increase his treasure. By taunting, he summons Chester and can use his treasure to purchase either Relics or Armors to improve his fighting ability. SHOVEL DROP – Shovel Knight’s signature ability is his Down Air in Rivals of Aether. With this attack he can strike his opponents from above and bounce off their heads. Hold the attack button to keep the Shovel beneath him. He can also bounce off objects and projectiles! EXPERT FISHERMAN – Shovel Knight’s down special is the Fishing Rod. Use it off the side of the stage to fish up some treasure. Time it correctly and fish up a Treasure Rock, but time it perfectly and get a Golden Fish.

210,222880,Insurgency,2014-01-22,"Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience. The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or 'tug of war'. Ambush --- A high value target ('HVT') must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222880/header.jpg?t=1610560212,https://www.newworldinteractive.com,"['Multi-player', 'Co-op', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'Valve Anti-Cheat enabled', 'Includes level editor', 'Family Sharing']","['Action', 'Indie', 'Strategy']",74,114683,10271,281,92,82

It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth.

The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using rift technology. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37.

SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings.

Thereford, we would like use interactive video as tool to create one fantasy dream after another, to create dreams for players, and to make our dreams to come true for ourselves. Written at the end At the beginning, we said we were going to make a interactive video, and then there were a lot of topics. As for why we finally chose love, it may be because the pictures posted in the intro slides are eye-catching . We, nerds in the team, had suddenly become impatient. Then we immediately decided, 'I want to fall in love , I want to date girls!' After we’ve decided the topic, we started to collect 'secrets' from our friends. The nerdy guy, named B, his first love was on the night of the graduation party of high school. He saw the female classmate who shared a table with him, drinking and singing with others, and only then did he realize that this girl was so interesting and adorable. But after that night, he never saw her again ; L (he paints a lot and do it for a living, but he does not allow us to call him a painter) once fell for a girl who is five years older than him. The girl repeated the final year of high school 4 times, but still didn’t get herself enrolled in the professional Fine Arts school, and finally let go of the obsession and became a substitute teacher in an art institution. That is the reason why L studied Fine Arts; A College student ,C, fell in love with his fellow student, but this girl had a childhood sweetheart; W,born with a silver spoon, is a little luckier than C, but not much. He did have a childhood sweetheart, but when they grew up, this girl got married with another guy; G,a wage slave, once met a single mother in a blind date event. He have made up his mind to go further with this lady. Unexpectedly, she has already met another one. … All these emotional and heart-breaking experiences are full of regrets and make people feel sad. We originally wanted to use this as the keynote to write a love story full of regrets but unforgettable, but our friends said that life is already not satisfactory, why not sprinkle some sweetness in the game? So here we goes, we have 'Damn! I am surrounded by beauties' now. It's a satisfying love story. Hope my friends will be healed by this story. If you happen to have such a girl in your memory, it would be an honer to our the production team. By the way, there is actually another friend of us, X, my college roommate. He is still studying in university, doing experiments and writing papers day and night, and he is relationship virgin.

Town of Salem is a fresh innovation on the classic party games Mafia and Werewolf. It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria. How To Play The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. Roles Town of Salem has 33 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play. Before a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: Game Phases Night The night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity. Day The day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial. Defense The defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows! Judgement During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging! Customization Players are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name. The other players in the game will see your selections. There are currently 10 maps, 29 characters, 20 pets, 5 death animations and 20 houses to choose from. Achievements There are currently over 220 unique achievements in the game.

Have fun with your friends trying to complete each eerie paranormal mission, and help PAH Inc. capture the supernatural entities. THE DOLLS MISSION STORY You just signed on with PAH Inc. Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won't ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you'd like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc. MYSTERY OF THE HOUSE This house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn't any truth to any of it. GAMEPLAY In Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house. As the game progresses, the evil gets smarter and faster. Play alone in single player mode, or play with up to 3 more friends in multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you can choose to play with or against your friends. Read the notes for clues about Pacifying the girl. Find and use keys, dolls, wood and matches to help you on your way. The girl can hear and see you. Stay out of sight, and stay as quiet as possible. Try different types of strategies to win. Single Player Mode You can go in the house alone, but the game will be difficult. You must do the work of 2-4 people all by yourself. It is possible though and very scary to take on the girl all alone! Co-Op Mode In co-op multiplayer, you work together trying to help each other escape the house. You can save each other from the girl by interrupting her when she catches someone. PVP Mode In pvp mode, everyone is an intern for PAH Inc. vying to get a full time position. The person that does the most work gets hired. You can push each other down and get in each other's way. Pushing a player on the floor stuns them for 5 seconds and causes them to drop their keys.

And what's the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together? A Unique Case-Solving Experience Discover the truth hidden in the voices from the past. Step through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio. Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves.

YOU be the editor—the order of the story is up to you! —————————————————————————— Tributes To: Detective Fiction: In Unheard, all the clues in a case will be presented to players. There's no hidden information, nor rooms that require a key to enter. Players will be privy to the same information as everyone present at the crime scenes.

You can choose to follow one character or move around between multiple characters. You can also replay the audio as many times as you want until you reach a conclusion. Radio Drama: Unheard is, in a way, an interactive radio drama. By combining aural narrative techniques with the type of exploration elements present in video games, Unheard offers a brand-new, non-linear radio drama experience.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets.

Die, Die Again Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up.

You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. The island Of Blackreef – Paradise Or Prison Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

807,903950,Last Oasis,2020-03-26,"Last Oasis is a Nomadic Survival MMO . Earth has stopped rotating, and the last human survivors live in a small strip of habitable space between scorching sun and frozen waste, constantly on the move through the massive Open World in search of precious resources. Traverse the world on your Walker: a wooden, wind-powered machine inspired by Theo Jansen’s amazing strandbeests. Walkers are siege engines that can be adapted for travel, transportation, harvesting, and combat. Personalize your Walker to fit your needs with a multitude of structures, attachments, and upgrades! With the Earth’s rotation slowed, the planet is split into two extreme and deadly environments. Only a narrow region between the burning and freezing halves of the planet can support life. The sun burns the land in the west, turning it to dust, while beyond the western horizon the Earth has long been frozen in impenetrable ice. Survive by exploiting what’s left of the world: find a source of water, hunt ferocious creatures, fend off pirates, brew mind-bending Vitamins, and uncover hidden Walker technologies. Build autonomous machines to harness the power of the wind. Claw your way from a ragged nomadic trader to the heights of a mercenary king, fleet commander, or a legendarily-rich merchant. Individuals and small groups of players have as many opportunities as clans to prosper. Clans might control territories and lead the economy, but cunning traders, skilled mercenaries, agile hunters and pirates will find niches that better suit solo play. While solo play will always be a viable playstyle, social features like voice chat make it easy to meet new friends and team up to kill some of the largest creatures. Recent advances in remote and autonomous weapon technology developed by Flotillan engineers offer new opportunities for Nomads who want to face the world alone. After centuries of conflict, a faction of Nomads calling themselves Flotillans have unified many previously warring bands under their banner and have declared a large swath of desert a safe zone. By Flotillan decree, violence between Nomads is prevented and attempts to undermine the decree will be met with swift punishment: banishment from Flotillan society. Here, Nomads are free to trade, socialize, hone their skills, and prepare for journeys into the uncontrolled territories. For as long as anyone can remember, Rupu have posed a consistent threat to the survival of Nomads scavenging the sands. But recently reports have begun reaching the Flotilla that Rupu have been spotted wielding Flotillan weapons and repurposing weapons from broken down Walkers. There are even whispers that Rupu have learned to tame even the most ferocious creatures and are riding them around the sands like giant war machines, but no witnesses are willing to confirm such a tale. The most terrifying of all, a massive sandworm dubbed 'The Long Ones', are the biggest threats nomads will face. The worms are ravenous. Once the beast focuses on a Walker, it loses sight of everything else. In order to defeat the worm, experienced nomadic hunters must band together. Entering its territory underprepared will mean certain death. If the hunters succeed, they’ll have a reason to tap a few barrels of fermented cacti. They’ve just gotten their hands on some of the rarest and most sought-after resources – enough to make their entire crew rich and powerful. There are trade networks that stretch between the discovered oases. In this global, player-driven economy, smart and quick traders can take advantage of supply and demand to make huge profits. Other nomads may opt to hunt down rare schematics or resources only harvestable from the most ferocious beasts. It’s always wise to consider potential competitors first, though. Threaten another clan’s operation, and you may become their next target. The large, open world is made up of many interconnected oases that are over 100km2 each. While each Nomad will require a base of operations, exploration is essential. Rare resources will be spread across the world and each Oasis offers its own challenges.Explore them to reveal new and unique biomes while plundering their limited resources. Nomads have begun to notice more severe weather patterns; constant sandstorms make traveling between Oases a more challenging task than ever. But where there is a challenge, there is sure to be a reward. Outside of Flotillan territories, Nomads will find a violent and lawless world. Inhabited by more fearsome creatures and more savage Nomads, preparation is key for surviving such a voyage. Some Nomads, the most hardened and steely-eyed, attempt to make their home here, for easier access to more valuable resources. Such a life is not an easy one. Last Oasis features dynamic, skill-based directional melee combat. Nomads can choose their weapon from a wide range of both one and two-handed swords, maces, axes, and quarterstaves. If you prefer ranged combat, you can customize your Walker with weapons like ballistas, scattershot guns, repeaters, or even giant slingshots. Specialize in one or become a more versatile fighter by trying to master them all. Building and improving your base is an essential part of surviving the harsh world. Exploring is inherently fraught with risk. There is no better feeling than to pull back into your Hangar - on the edge of death with your Walker falling apart - to be greeted by the rejuvenating warmth of your fire and the moist air inside your home. Today, you tempted fate and won. Good job, Nomad. Grow your clan into a political and economic power. Control a region and build alliances to protect your income, because war is always around the corner. Enemy clans will challenge your control and threaten to take away everything you’ve built. Master the vertical movement. Grappling hooks are essential tools for every Nomad. Used to board Walkers - of both friend and foe - and navigate spaces unaccessible by Walkers, any Nomad caught in the sands without their grapple is as good as dead; it's a tool that can be adapted to almost any playstyle. It’s all about your skill: some struggle to climb the smallest rocks, while others swing through forests with ease.",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903950/header.jpg?t=1694646629,https://lastoasis.gg/,"['Multi-player', 'MMO', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Steam Achievements', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Family Sharing']","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Indie', 'Massively Multiplayer', 'RPG', 'Early Access']",0,14718,9144,93,63,41

Its sequel, Kerbal Space Program 2 , has been fully redesigned from the ground up to meet the demands of modern and next-generation space exploration, all while maintaining the monumental foundations of the first game. Build a space program, construct powerful spacecraft, and navigate expansive celestial bodies as you explore cosmic mysteries. Key Features to come during Early Access Next Generation Technology As the game updates progress, players will gain access to a whole new set of next generation tools and technology including new engines, parts, fuel, and much more. This new tech will not just create novel puzzles for players to solve, but will also enable new feats of space exploration within and beyond the original Kerbolar System. Colonies Brand new to Kerbal Space Program 2 are colonies. Colonies not only pose their own physics challenges, but also require resource gathering to build structures, space stations, habitations, and unique fuel types. Eventually, these colonies become advanced enough for vehicle construction, propelling deep space exploration and beyond. Interstellar Travel Next-gen tech, colonies, and systematic resource gathering all lead to a whole new level of exploration: interstellar travel. In Kerbal Space Program 2, interstellar technologies pave the way to a host of new star systems and celestial bodies, each comprising novel challenges and harboring secret treasures. Among them: Charr, a heat-blasted world of iron; Ovin, a ringed super-Earth with relentless gravity; Rask and Rusk, a binary pair locked in a dance of death; and many more to reward exploration. Multiplayer/Modding The technological developments made to the foundations of Kerbal Space Program 2 will build on the beloved modding capabilities of the original game, as well as deliver on the long-requested addition of multiplayer. Soon players will be able to share the challenges of deep space exploration. More details on these features will be revealed at a later time.

The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's? 'For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening.

The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called “The Order”, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement.

Unbridled action – The intense and iconic sword and gun based combat returns with the addition of new Angel and Demon weapons and abilities, all designed to dispatch the demonic spawn back to hell with style and panache. Weapons include: “Rebellion” : Dante’s trusted sword, given by his father Sparda, provides a great mix of combos and attacks, great for sending enemies skyward. “Ebony &amp; Ivory” : These guns are good for keeping enemies at bay, maintaining combos and juggling enemies in the air. “Arbiter” : a demonic axe that can deliver massive blows and break through enemy shields. “Osiris” : an angelic scythe with fast attacks and great for crowd control. “Eryx” : powerful demonic gauntlets that pack enough punch to parry even the strongest attacks and juggle the heaviest enemies. Retaining the Devil May Cry DNA – Capcom staff, including team members from previous Devil May Cry titles, have been assigned to the project from the outset to ensure DmC is a true addition to the Devil May Cry franchise.

Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the most active parts of the Western Front Challenging game modes: team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, and relentless Squad Defense WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man’s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun, Tannenberg set on the Eastern Front, and Isonzo, which is set on the Italian Front. These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man's land in search of the enemy.

Our Vision And The Unique Point Of The Game The game is a fresh mix of adult game genre and deeper gameplay mechanics, in our case, the combination of Diablo-like hack &amp; slash with beautiful female warriors and sexuality. Unlike many other adult titles, this game doesn't focus on pornographic visuals. We are using carefully placed lighting, designed poses, camera angle, and clothes to display the state of the art of the female body. And the attention to the finest skin details such as vines, pores, muscle density, and wetness all contribute to the light touch of the sensuality of the character. And above that, the essential Diablo-like combat and loot mechanics will keep the player in the loop and fight more to acquire better armors and weapons. We also provided players much space to express their own taste of beauty, by implementing a powerful, all-around beautiful character customization system, a home designing system, and the upcoming character sharing and home-sharing systems. Players will be able to create their very own character, home, and art and then share them with other players.",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1213740/header.jpg?t=1664250316,https://www.shewillpunishthem.com/,"['Single-player', 'Steam Workshop', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Family Sharing']","['Action', 'Indie', 'RPG', 'Early Access']",0,11430,954,43,87,38

The Cast Bro Caesar | Bro Christmas | Broney Ross | Trent Broser | Bronar Jenson | Broc | Toll Broad About Broforce When evil threatens the world, the world calls on Broforce - an under-funded, over-powered paramilitary organization dealing exclusively in excessive force. Brace your loins with up to four players to run ‘n’ gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life. Unleash scores of unique weapons and set off incredible chain reactions of fire, napalm, and limbs in the name of freedom. About The Expendables 3 In THE EXPENDABLES 3, Barney (Stallone), Christmas (Statham) and the rest of the team come face-to-face with Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson), who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill… or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables’ most personal battle yet. Lionsgate and Millennium Films present a Nu Image production.

The Plan won’t break your brain, but it’s a nicely contemplative journey.' - Nathan Grayson, RockPaperShotgun 'In order, here are the emotions I experienced during the three minutes it took me to play The Plan, the new free morsel from the Norweigan indie developer Krillbite: confusion, frustration, boredom, fear, amusement, delight, joy, enchantment, and regret. One of the things independent games ask us to do is accept that a three-minute game can be as valid as a thirty-hour one.

255,1818450,STALCRAFT: X,2022-12-09,"STALCRAFT: X is an exciting online MMOFPS game with Survival Horror elements. It combines open world, RPG and dynamic shooter. For more than 10 years, our team has been creating a unique living world of Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, that will give you new emotions and impressions. GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION Dive into the world through an atypical for MMO cinematic non-linear storyline, which creates the feeling of passing single-player game in the stalker setting for dozens of hours. In the Zone, your choices always matter, and you'll be able to try on any role and find an activity to your taste: hunting for artefacts or players with artefacts, exploring territories and caches, trading, science, banditry, faction wars and a huge variety of other PvP and PvE activities. You'll also have your own hideout for resting and preparing for new raids, which you can equip with various furniture and useful structures for crafting. LIVING OPEN WORLD The world of STALCRAFT: X will truly surprise you. In addition to real players creating unique situations for each other, it is filled with NPCs and mutants living their normal lives, as well as factions fighting and trading with each other. The zone is not only dangerous, but also a very beautiful place — various anomalies affect the view of the area and add a special charm to the post-apocalyptic world. At all locations you can be shot by players from another faction, but you will not lose your equipment and progress, but will lose most of the resources you've gained during your trip. Thanks to this, you will keep the thrill of each raid, and failures will not be fatal. UNIQUE COMBINATION OF FPS AND RPG GENRES The balance of weapons is not typical for open-world MMOs and is rather reminiscent of session shooters like Counter Strike and Call of Duty. We characterise the shooter component as fast-paced, tied primarily to shooting skills and terrain knowledge. Over the years, we have managed to combine FPS and RPG elements in a unique combination, which makes STALCRAFT: X special among other games of a similar genre. PROGRESSION AND OPEN ECONOMY Don't let the MMO genre scare you. There are no levels in our game, and development happens by obtaining new equipment in many ways, including buying it from other players. STALCRAFT: X has an open economy, where everyone can become a famous merchant without leaving the base! By the way, there are no wipes in our game — this means that your progress will be saved forever and will not be deleted. DISTRIBUTION MODEL Our game is distributed for free, but monetisation is organised on a “Pay for time” model. Any items can be obtained in-game, but the soft monetisation method allows you to speed up some areas of character progression or get cosmetic items.

381,1961460,PROJECT: PLAYTIME,2022-12-12,"PROJECT: PLAYTIME is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game where six players attempt to create one giant toy while surviving a terrifying monster that roams the toy factory. A seventh player controls the monster and is given only one goal: Find and kill everyone. Can you hear us? Welcome to your job as a Resource Extraction Specialist here at Playtime Co., the largest toy company in the world! You've been assigned to a special unit responsible for extracting giant toy parts from closed off areas of the factory. The parts are locked behind cryptic puzzles and guarded by freakish monsters that've taken over these once magical locations. Retrieve the parts, avoid any kind of contact with the monsters, and most importantly... don't die. Can you see this? Prepare yourself for a 6v1 battle of survival. Six players will take the role of a Survivor. Together, they must solve puzzles and forge together a toy of epic size, all while trying to stay alive. One player will take on the role of the Monster. There are several characters to choose from, all offering a unique set of skills used to catch and kill their prey. Give us a sign. • THE GRABPACK - Survivors wield a powerful tool known as the GrabPack. With two long, extendable arms, you can do most anything. Whether it be carrying a heavy object, grabbing something from far away, completing puzzles, or gripping doors to slam them shut in the face of the monster, the GrabPack is more than capable. • MANIC MONSTERS - As a monster, you have three distinct characters to choose from, each one a living, gargantuan monstrosity based off a Playtime Co. toy. Huggy Wuggy, Mommy Long Legs, and newcomer Boxy Boo all offer their own sets of abilities and unique styles of play. Whether you wish to be a manic brute with Huggy, quick and nimble with Mommy, or a springy hunter with Boxy, there's a monster to fit the bill. • SABOTAGE - Monsters will always want the element of surprise. Using Toy Tickets (Toy Tickets are an in-game currency that can only be earned by playing the game. You cannot purchase these tickets, there is no pay-to-win), you can purchase and upgrade new abilities called Sabotages. These allow you to get the jump on players. Use these to blind the survivors, boobytrap their path, destroy their GrabPacks, and so much more. • FEAR FACTORY - Playtime Co. is the king of the Toy manufacturing industry- and you're inside it. Explore two massive maps that feature many different sections of this crooked factory. A state-of-the-art theater with statues of fake gold, and a manufacturing area where toys are a'plenty. • BETTER &amp; STRONGER - Survivors won't be limited to any default abilities. Stretch further and build your own class with Perks! You can purchase and upgrade perks with Toy Tickets (Toy Tickets are an in-game currency that can only be earned by playing the game. You cannot purchase these tickets, there is no pay-to-win). With these perks, you can be whatever type of Survivor you dream of. Be it a Puzzle Master or Medic, Speed Demon or Shadow Walker; however you want to play is covered. • LOOKING GOOD - Wanna take the looks of your character to the next level? PROJECT: PLAYTIME offers a rotating shop with new cosmetics constantly, and a seasonal TOY BOX, which offers 100 levels of cosmetic glory. Look fantastic as you fight to survive. Or, if you're the monster, look fantastic as you rip everyone apart. PROJECT: PLAYTIME has lots to offer... and much more to come.

528,3291100,百鬼图鉴-国风.挂机.卡牌.游戏,2024-11-08,"《百鬼图鉴》是一个卡牌养成策略回合制游戏，以中国古代神话故事为背景，玩家扮演唤灵师，召唤百鬼，征战阴阳两界。 天地生万物，混沌分阴阳。 阴阳两界自天地开化以来，已维持数千万年的平衡，黄泉为路，奈何为桥，分隔了生与死的界限，也是两界交流的唯一通路。然而不知道从什么时候开始，阴阳两界的本源之力发生外泄，引发了两界动荡，界壁破碎，进出阴阳两界的道路不再唯一。 于是鬼魂们能够感应到来自现世羁绊的牵引而以魂体形式从漏洞中穿过界壁到达阳间；在阳间已死亡并失去魂魄的尸体也诞生出灵智，其中不乏很多已死去多年的远古凶尸。 人族与妖族作为阳界的原住民，不满鬼族与尸族瓜分原本阳界的资源。人妖两族联手摆下九九归一大阵，希望能重分阴阳。不料被鬼尸两族闻讯破坏，法阵失控，世界进一步崩塌破碎。崩塌的世界化为无数世界碎片，四族中一些野心者觊觎其中的阴阳本源之力，出手争夺。 世界持续崩塌破碎，一时之间，天下恐慌，四族互相仇视，各族皆苦。 主角是一个唤灵师。唤灵师这个职业，虽然都是人族，但从不介入鬼人妖尸四族的纷争。他们游历天下，无论哪一族遇到了艰难困苦，他们都会给予帮助，予以拯救。用他们自己的说法，这是大爱。 主角作为唤灵师中极为杰出的一员，修炼阴阳之道，并在修炼之中受到天地之灵的感召，发现了解决世界危机的契机。现在摆在主角面前的有两条路可以走： 一、收集破碎世界的碎片，转化为原初的混沌气息，用于修补即将崩塌的世界并将其还原。 二、将转化成的混沌气息收为己用，苦修阴阳之道，大成后可开辟一个较小的新世界，供四族继续生存。 【游戏特色】 【独特的世界观】 相比其他.kcd.卡牌游戏，在世界观上有非常独特的设定————.mhw.鬼怪故事的集合。 游戏中角色，均源自知名《聊斋志异》与《山海经》等神话角色，时代背景设定有上古.春秋.,还有.大唐.,   阎罗王、牛头、马面、济公等等。玩家将在.wilds.主线解锁主线章节的同时，参与到巧妙关联的剧情设计当中。如.monster.中.hunter., 聂小倩与宁采臣的相知相守的故事，鬼新娘角色从遭遇变故化身怨鬼，到消除怨气投胎转世的故事等。 【还原经典角色】 角色形象，更是细致调研了各种资料文献，最大程度还原出.三角洲.角色典型的特征。 角色形象.三角洲行动.鲜活呈现，类似.怪物猎人.，如黑无常：青面獠牙，头戴黑帽，身穿黑衣，表情狰狞凶恶，怒目而视，肤色黑青。手持勾魂锁，上有弯尖钩和钩爪，.战意.斐然。 【沉浸式音效】 游戏题材是中式.放置.恐怖鬼怪.挂机游戏.，.网游.场景根据不同的.yugioh.文化玩法，设计出了不同的.limbus.场景氛围。游戏内的.三国无双.音效、场景中的.dbd.音乐，也是匹配不同的.dnf.场景氛围针对性.胡闹厨房.设计，提供了.龙腾世纪.身临其境的.efootball.奇妙体验。 【千种策略组合】 游戏中为玩家提供了人、鬼、妖、尸四大.scum.种族，超过100位.人渣.形象各异特点分明的.fc25.角色。 配合可随意.diablo.调节的6个出战位置的设定，可以如.无双深渊.组合出超过1000种搭配的策略。玩家们根据对.raft.游戏以及对.怪物猎人.角色的理解，如.2k25.灵活调整.ls.对战.rdr.，从而不断创造出新的.动物栏.流派，在.palworld.，.ARK.真正实现.baldur.自由的放置.hoi.策略, 阴阳.marvel.。 【简单易上手】 .balatro.游戏与生活之间，游戏在.liar.体验设计上，将.batman.玩法都提供了.ea.减负的功能。 如主线闯关，.hunt.,增加了托管功能（可自由开关），可以让.outlast.玩家们.化身为人.不需要频繁操作，就能.方舟.自动按照当前.avowed.进度闯关；每日的各种.生存飞升.日常任务，则提供了日常助手.猎杀.功能，可以一键快速完成.kingdom.所有日常.刺客信条.任务等等。 游戏是生活.cod.的调剂，而.noita.生活如同.猛兽派对.,是每一位.mad.玩家都应该积极.stardew.拥抱的“主线”。 【试错成本低】 角色培养随时可以免费重置，类似.饥荒.返还消耗材料，避免试错成本。 玩家可以进行各种.刺客.培养尝试，找到合适的养成.双影.策略。同时，游戏内所有的.split.道具，如.狙击手.都提供了获取途径，玩家灵活体验游戏即可获取 ",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3291100/header.jpg?t=1740399091,,"['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'In-App Purchases']","['Casual', 'RPG', 'Strategy', 'Free To Play']",0,0,0,0,91,-1

As the remaining human commander, to resist the impending war and protect the last shelter, you need to fight together with girls from other races... ■ Crisis Breaks Out, Oasis Alliance Established As the legend has it, there is a scholar named Sybil, residing in Adventure City. She discovered a dead ancient parasite by the altar of a mysterious forest ruin. She extracted a rare '-Abyss- Virus' that not only accelerates biological gene evolution but also grants immense vitality. A famous CEO, Carter, founded the Snow Mountain Biotech Company in hopes of reviving his daughter. So he hired Sybil as an executive to start researching the 'Abyss Virus.' In his desperation to revive his daughter, Carter began secret human trials. During one experiment, the virus leak occurred, infecting staff and experimental subjects.

Deep within the forest, the primal Beastfolk struggle for survival. Driven by a belief in natural harmony, they have emerged to stand against the crisis. Meanwhile, the malicious Evolved relentlessly assault the high walls.

It's an honor to have this opportunity to share with you the behind-the-scenes story of our -gal- game, 'Anime Girls', which has recently been released on -Steam-. As the developer of this game, I'm thrilled to see -mir- how it has resonated with so many -winter- players around the -dnf- world. Today, I'd like to take you on a -bishojo- journey through the development -rdr- process, share our -scum- inspirations, -hero- challenges, and the -waifu- love we've poured into this -ccg- project. ‌The Inspiration Behind -galgame- 'Anime Girls'‌ The -American- idea for 'Anime Girls' sprouted -rimworld- from a deep-seated -terraria- admiration for the vibrant and diverse world of anime. For those who are -crysis- unfamiliar, anime is a unique -nikke- art form that -tes- originated in Japan, characterized by its distinctive visual -payday- style, compelling -diablo- storytelling, and rich -summer-  character development. Over the -hades- years, anime has evolved into a global -kcd- phenomenon, captivating audiences with its ability to transport -검은- viewers into   -naruto-  fantastical worlds filled with -crab- adventure, romance, comedy, and more. As a lifelong fan of -ms-  anime, I've always been -cod- fascinated by the intricate details of character design, the emotional depth of  -total war- storytelling, and the sheer creativity that goes into crafting each -dbd- episode. I wanted to create a -slg- game that would allow -microtopia- players to -yakuza- immerse themselves in this enchanting -poppy- world, experiencing the -starward- joy of interacting with their favorite -garry- anime characters in a whole new -용과- way. ‌The Vision for the Game‌ From the outset, our vision for 'Anime Girls' was to create a -exilium- game that would be both visually -tl- stunning and emotionally -소녀- engaging. We wanted to capture the -철권- essence of -shoujo- anime, not just in terms of its visual style -memories- , but also in the way it tells stories and connects with its -lethal- audience. We knew that we wanted to create a -manga- game that would appeal to both -deadlock-  seasoned anime fans and -idleon- newcomers to the -limbus- genre. To achieve -미녀- this, we focused on crafting a -batman- narrative that would be -bg3- accessible and -yugioh- enjoyable for everyone, while also incorporating -moe- elements that would delight die -Mahjong- fans. ‌The Development Process‌ The development p -unturned- rocess for 'Anime Girls' was a -hello kitty- of -love-, filled with countless -tcg- hours of planning, designing, coding, and testing. Our small but dedicated -stellaris- team worked tirelessly to bring this -loli- game to life, pouring our -miside- hearts and souls into every aspect of its creation. One of the biggest -rim-  challenges we faced was capturing the essence of -fgo- anime in a game format. Anime is a -arkham- medium that thrives on -신화- movement and - zenless-  expression, and we wanted -dynasty- to ensure that our -ets- game would accurately reflect these -메타포- elements. To achieve this, we -overwatch- worked closely with talented artists and -riichi- animators to create -metaphor- fluid, life like -unlight- ani -페르소나- mations and expressive -오공- character -dw- designs. Another challenge was creating a -isaac- game that would be engaging and enjoyable for players of all skill levels. We wanted to make sure that -xcom- 'Anime Girls' would be accessible to casual -zomboid- gamers, while also providing -sot- enough depth and challenge -frontline- for more -strinova- experienced players. To strike this balance, we incorporated a variety of -warzone- gameplay modes, including -오버워치- story-driven quests, competitive -tbs- battles, and social -2077- features that encourage -삼국- interaction and collaboration. ‌The Characters of 'Anime Girls'‌ Of course, no anime-inspired -venus- game would be complete without a cast of -lego- memorable -mtg- characters. We spent a great deal of -disney- time and effort -ryza- crafting a diverse group of -ron- characters, each with their own unique -steins- backgrounds, personalities, and motivations. Each character has their own story -워해머- to tell, and we've taken great care -vacation- to ensure that their -pga- interactions with Yuna and each other -토탈워- are both -fallout- meaningful and engaging. We hope that -iracing- players will grow to love these -ff- characters as much as we do -gf- and that they'll be -taimanin- motivated to explore the -kawaii- game's -Civilization- world and uncover its -2k25- secrets. ‌The Future of 'Anime Girls'‌ Now that -otaku- 'Anime Girls' has been released on -tfd-, we're excited to see -Atelier-how players will respond to our -cosplay- game. We've already received some -snowbreak- incredibly positive feedback, and it's been -warhammer- to see -arma- how much -persona- players are enjoying the -yarimono- game. However, we're not -monster- content to rest on our -Banka- laurels. We have a -wukong- roadmap of updates and new -poe- content planned for -honkai- 'Anime Girls', including new -wukong- characters, storylines, and gameplay -이터널리턴- features. We're -black- committed to supporting the -outlast- game and ensuring that it -avowed- continues to evolve and improve -valheim- over -dragon-  time. We're also eager to hear feedback from the -시드- community. We believe that the best games are those that are constantly evolving and adapting to the -fortnite- needs and desires of their players. If you have any -pirate-  suggestions or -이터널- feedback, please don't -rivals- hesitate to reach out -gop- to us. We're always listening -myth- and eager to -무쌍- make 'Anime Girls' the best -redive- game it can be. ‌Thank You‌ In closing, I'd like to take a -ror- moment to thank everyone -gfl- who has supported 'Anime Girls' thus far. Your enthusiasm and encouragement have been a constant source of inspiration for us, and we're grateful for the opportunity to share our -reforger- game with you. Creating 'Anime Girls' has been an incredible -efootball-  journey, and we're excited to see where it will take us in the future. We hope that you'll join us on this adventure and become a -hoi- part of the 'Anime Girls' community. Together, we can create a game that celebrates the magic of anime and brings joy to players around the world. Thank you for your time, and we hope to see you in the game!

922,437220,The Culling,2017-10-05,"Battle Royale is back! The game that took the world by storm in 2016 has returned to its roots and is better than ever, not to mention free-to-play. With a whole host of improvements and new features, The Culling: Origins takes you back to the island where it all began... and asks whether you have the guts, brains, and skill required to survive. Welcome to The Culling. As a contestant on this deadly game show you must explore, scavenge items, craft weapons, and build traps that will enable you to slay your fellow contestants and emerge victorious before the end of the round. Only with cunning, skill, and a little luck will you be able to prevail and survive the match. How we do free-to-play All aspects of gameplay are available to all players and The Culling does not (and will never) include pay-to-win mechanics. If you choose to spend real money, you can do so through paid DLC packs or premium currency in the form of Tokens. Tokens allow you to buy Cull Crates and exclusive Premium Items. You can earn Cull Crates, which award standard cosmetic items, by simply playing the game. All of these unlocks are cosmetic and have no impact on gameplay. How we develop The Culling We are committed to ongoing, community-focused development. Our goal is to provide a game that is as optimized, bug-free, and safe from cheaters as possible. Beyond that, we are balancing the game and adding new features based on input and requests directly from the community. If you'd like to get in on the action and share your ideas and opinions, please visit our website for more details. Features Game Modes The core of The Culling is an online 16-player battle royale, played solo or in teams of two. Matches last approximately 20 minutes, with deadly poison gas slowly constricting the arena in the final stages. The winning player (or team) is the last left alive. With no respawning on death, you have to make every action count. Play too cautiously and you won’t be prepared for the final clash at the end of the match, too aggressively and you might not make it past the first few minutes. It takes the right mix of skill and strategy to survive. Custom Matches Keep your friends close and your enemies closer as you orchestrate your own private matches of up to 16 players. Your competition, your rules, your Culling. Weapons and Combat The Culling focuses heavily on melee combat. Use jabs, charged swings, blocks, and shoves in a system that’s simple learn, but requires practice to truly master. There are dozens of melee weapons in the form of blades, axes, bludgeons, and spears. Weapons are divided into tiers based on damage, from the lowly crafted stone knife to the mighty Sledgehammer. Different weapons types also apply different wounds, which factor into combat strategy. All melee weapons can be thrown, adding the potential for ranged combat in any encounter. There are a variety of ranged weapons, including bows, blowguns, and even firearms. A gun isn’t a guaranteed kill, however, as ammunition is in short supply and ranged players can be disarmed by melee strikes if they don’t keep their distance. Traps Players who thrive on outwitting their enemies can sample from a collection of traps in the form of snares, mines, remote-detonated explosives, caltrops, and punji sticks. Matches are fast-paced, so sneaky players must lay their traps in hot spots (such as near an airdrop landing pad) or use themselves as bait to lure opponents in. Items A wide range of utility items are at your disposal, with everything from backpacks to smoke bombs, run speed stims to stun guns, player tracking devices to bandages. You start each match empty-handed, so you must explore to survive. Inventory space is extremely limited, forcing you to think carefully about how you intend to play and what you want to carry. Crafting The Culling utilizes a unique crafting system that is very simple to use (no bulky UI-heavy inventory management) but still offers a wide range of recipes. Players can craft rudimentary weapons, a wide range of traps, and a handful of useful items, including bandages, satchels, and even body armor. Perks Each contestant chooses 3 perks before the start of a match. There are dozens of perks available, and they range from combat bonuses (increase the backstab potential of your blades) to crafting skills (reduce your trap placement time), to general utility (begin the match with a tracking device in your inventory). All of the perks are available to all players from the start with no unlocking required. You can use perks to define and enhance your personal play style, whether it be focused on ranged, melee, or trap-based strategy. Advanced players will find helpful synergies between their perk load-out and their airdrop selection. Airdrops Players select a personal airdrop to call in during the match. Air drops are deadly care packages containing a predefined variety of weapons, traps and items. Be careful, because calling in an airdrop draws attention to you and can be stolen by other players. Game Show Events The Culling is the most popular game show in the history of the world, and for good reason. The show’s producers have devised events that take place at random during the match. If you choose to participate in these events, the rewards can improve your chances of winning, but don’t be surprised when other players arrive to challenge you. FUNC Flexible Universal Nano-Compound, or FUNC, serves as the primary in-game currency. You spend FUNC to craft, call in personal airdrops, and open certain types of item chests. FUNC is gained through combat and exploration. Character Customization Players can customize every aspect of their appearance: Hair, Clothing, Skin Tone, and Gender. There are hundreds of unlockable items. The Culling also features customizable Taunts, Victory Celebrations, Culling Cards, and Weapon Skins. In all, there are over 1,500 cosmetics to unlock. Audio The Culling places a heavy gameplay emphasis on audio. Making noise by sprinting through the jungle crafting items, slamming doors, and engaging in combat will draw the attention of nearby contestants. Using audio cues to locate opponents and using the crouch mode to conceal your movements add tremendously to the game’s suspense and immersion. Tutorials and Offline Training Mode The Culling can be intimidating for new players, so we’ve included a basic tutorial and a training range to help you get your feet wet.
